# Arch-config
Configuration for my Arch system

Setting up this repository to store all of the changes I make to my system.
This way I can automatically download all of my configurations and dotfiles should anything happen.
This will be an acting repository for any backup I generate for my custom configuration.
New folders will be added to separate the different programs used on my system.
